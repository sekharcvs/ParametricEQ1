EXE provided is ParametricEQ.exe

Command line description:

ParametricEQ.exe <input_stream_path> <output_stream_path> <eq_gains_stream_path> <Sampling_Rate>

The processing is done on a 20ms frame basis (This can be changed on request).

Input Description:
<input_stream_path>    - Input is a 16-bit signed integer raw(aka binary) file/stream.
<output_stream_path>   - Output is a 16-bit signed integer raw(aka binary) file/stream.
<eq_gains_stream_path> - Is a binary file which specifies the eq gains for 14 bands per each processing frame.
<Sampling_Rate>        - A number specifying the input/output sampling rate (e.g., 32000).

Sample rates supported: 8000, 16000, 32000, 44100 and 48000.

Details:

An option in the file options.h called IO_SHORT can be used to control whether to use Input/Output of 16-bit integer or 32-bit float.
Another option called DEBUGGING can be used to print some debug parameters. (This can be cleaned up later)

Eq Band centers (approximate locations at sampling rates other than 48 kHz):
20, 80, 160, 560, 880, 1340, 1940, 2800, 4320, 6920, 11120, 16240, 21420 (spanning 14 bands)
This can be changed.

Other details:
Real-time processing delay is 30ms (meaning, the output sample corresponding to the current sample is generated 30 ms after receiving the current sample).
