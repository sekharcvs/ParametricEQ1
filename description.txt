EXE provided is ParametricEQ.exe

Command line description:

ParametricEQ.exe <input_stream_path> <output_stream_path> <eq_gains_stream_path> <Sampling_Rate>
Example of a command line is provided at: Debug folder at .\Debug\cmds.bat
The batch file uses an EQ file which applies an EQ gain of +3dB between bands [5-9]. (Based on the band limits described below, 720 to 5280 Hz).

The processing is done on a 20ms frame basis (This can be changed on request).

Input Description:
<input_stream_path>    - Input is a 16-bit signed integer raw(aka binary) file/stream.
<output_stream_path>   - Output is a 16-bit signed integer raw(aka binary) file/stream.
<eq_gains_stream_path> - Is a binary file which specifies the eq gains for 14 bands per each processing frame.
<Sampling_Rate>        - A number specifying the input/output sampling rate (e.g., 32000).

Sample rates supported: 8000, 16000, 32000, 44100 and 48000.

Details:

An option in the file options.h called IO_SHORT can be used to control whether to use Input/Output of 16-bit integer or 32-bit float.
Another option called DEBUGGING can be used to print some debug parameters. (This can be cleaned up later)

This can be changed.

Other details:
Real-time processing delay is 30ms (meaning, the output sample corresponding to the current sample is generated 30 ms after receiving the current sample).
